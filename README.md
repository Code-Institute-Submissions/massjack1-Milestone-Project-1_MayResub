# Mass Jack's Portfolio Website
 This website is a collection of my ideas & an insight into what I do. My background, My goals & My Vision.



## User Experience
 This Website is generally for Companies looking for a Developer that fits their values but also 
 for other developers or anyone looking for inspiration. I hope that the User Experience 
 is wellpleased and organised for any viewers to achieve their needs. The sense I'm going for 
 is the thought of connecting the A with the B. The Basis with the ground. A reliable idea.
